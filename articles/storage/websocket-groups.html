    Websocket Groups
</h1>

<p>
    Web Socket Groups is a feature that allows your clients to create their own web socket connection to the server, and share data with other web sockets on the same server.<br>
    A few important notes to know bfore you enable Web Socket Groups on your server...
</p>

<ul class="card-list">
    <li>
        <span class="fa fa-circle"></span>
        <p>
            Groups exist in the server's Random Access Memory (RAM).<br>
            <small>
                <span class="fa fa-angle-right"></span>
                This means that groups are volatile, so once the server shuts down, all groups are lost.<br />
                <span class="fa fa-angle-right"></span>
                Each group's pointer is held inside a
                <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Map.html"><u>Map&lt;String,WebSocketGroup&gt;</u></a>
            </small>
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <span class="fa fa-circle"></span>
        <p>
            Each group must be generated through the provided API, which will assign an unique id to the group itself.<br>
            <small>
                The api is located at <a target="_blank" href="/@Set/webSocketGroup"><u>/@Set/webSocketGroup</u></a>.<br>
                If web socket groups are enabled, the server will respond with the id of the created web socket.

<h2>How to enable Web Socket Groups</h2>

<p>
    WS groups are disabled by default for the standalone archive.<br>
    In order to enable it, you need to specify some fields in your <b>http.json</b> file.
</p>

<pre highlight="json" src="articles/storage/files/http1.json"></pre>

<p>
    The field <b>groups</b>, specifies information about your ws groups.<br>
    Set <b>allow</b> to <b>true</b>, and you are done.
</p>

<h2>How to create a Web Socket Group</h2>

<p>
    As I mentioned above, you can create a web socket group through the <b>/@Set/webSocketGroup</b> API.<br>
    The request can be either a GET or a POST request.
    The server will create a group, assign it an unique id based on your session id, a visibility state and a name based on the parameters given.
    The group will be saveed in memory, and the unique id of the group will be sent back to the client through http as a response to the request.
</p>

<pre highlight="javascript" src="articles/storage/files/createGroup.js"></pre>

<p>
    This function will create a group and return its id.<br />
    <b>Note</b>  that the requests specifies an url query field names  <b>visibility</b>, this field specifies wether the group can be public or private.
</p>

<p>
    You can use that id to actually join the group data stream.
    In order to do so, you must open a web socket connection through the provided api
    <b>/@WebSocketGroupApplicationProgramInterface?join=<u>{id}</u></b>
</p>

<pre highlight="javascript" src="articles/storage/files/joinGroup.js"></pre>

<p>
    Let's write a simple example, a web chat application with different groups.<br>
    Users can create their own public group to chat with others, and they are free to switch between groups.

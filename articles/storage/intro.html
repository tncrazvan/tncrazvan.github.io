<h2>
    About ElkServer
</h2>

<p>
    ElkServer is a Java library which offers a few tools which (hopefuly) will
    help you create your own customized web server.<br>
    <b>MVC</b> (Model-View-Controller) is the default designed pattern used, although you can make your own changes,
    I suggest you start by working with the default design pattern as the library itself
    has been written assuming the web server is sitting ontop of a MVC pattern.<br>
    For example, the data regarding each http or web socket request is directly passed
    to the specific controller meant to answer the given request.

<h2>
    Why would I write this library?
</h2>
<p>
    Java Servlets work just fine, they provide much of the same features,
    so ofcourse one would ask himself why bother with this project?<br>
</p>
<br />
<ul class="card-list">
    <li>
        <span class="fa fa-circle"></span>
        <p>
            While Java Servlets are pretty stable, sometimes they are a bit of an overkill.<br>
            <small>
                For example, you don't need a whole java servlet to provide a simple api for your newspapers web service.
            </small>
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <span class="fa fa-circle"></span>
        <p>
            ElkServer is not a framework, it's a normal library.<br>
            <small>
                My goal is to keep it simple.<br>
                As long as you know the basics of java, you should be just fine.<br>
                There are only a few new concepts that you are required to understand before getting started, 
                and I'll guide you through them.
            </small>
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <span class="fa fa-circle"></span>
        <p>
            You are not required to compile a whole project. Download and run!<br>
            <small>
                Although you can import ElkServer in your project, you are not required to do so.<br>
                The java archive itself comes with default settings, 
                which allows you to run it as normal web server.
            </small>
        </p>
        
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>
    The library is meant to be easy to understand and use, so that anyone
    can make their own changes and improvements to the code.<br>

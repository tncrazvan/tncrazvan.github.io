    Getting started
</h1>
<br />
<br />
<p>
    First thing you need to download the most recent release.<br>
    You can find all official releases at
    <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/tncrazvan/ElkServer/releases">
        https://github.com/tncrazvan/ElkServer/releases
    </a>
</p>

<p>Once you've downloaded the java archive, you can now start creating your web application.</p>

<h2>Http.json</h2>

<p>
    Make a new file, named <b>http.json</b>.<br>
    This file will be fed to the web server, it contains basic information about
    your web server and your web application, like the character set your server should be using,
    the port, binding address, ecc..
</p>

<p>
    It's time to write down your server details inside <b>http.json</b>.
</p>
<pre><code highlight="javascript">{
    "port":80,
    "webRoot": "www/", //your website directory (relative to this json file)
    "charset": "UTF-8",
    "timeout": 5000,
    "bindAddress": "::" // :: means the server will bind on all available addresses
}</code></pre>

<p>
    Most of the file contains generic information, I'm going to asume that you are familiar with Socket technology
    and  you understand what many of the fields mean.
</p>

<h2>Web Controllers</h2>
<p>
    Controllers, as in 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">Model-View-Controller (MVC)</a>, 
    are the main request managers for you web application.<br>
    We haven't wrote any code yet, however, there are a few controllers set by default, such as <b>ControllerNotFound</b>, which triggers when
    a given resource is not found on the server.
</p>

<p>
    In order for the web server to know where to find these controllers, the http.json file needs to specify the exact package
    in which they exist.
</p>

<p>
    In this case, we are not importing the java archive in a customized project, we are instead
    directly using it as a standalone project, so we don't need to define any package for http and web socket controllers, 
    instead the default packages will be used.
</p>


<h2>Index.html</h2>

<p>
    Make a new directory named <b>www/</b> and make a new file <b>www/index.html</b>.<br>
    This file will be your application entry point, so throw your html template inside it.
</p>

<pre><code highlight="html" src="articles/storage/index.html"></code></pre>

<h2>Start the web server</h2>

<p>
    Everything is ready, you can start your server now.
    Make sure your Java Environment is installed, and run your server.
</p>

<pre><code highlight="bash">java -jar ElkServer-1.0.0.jar http.json</code></pre>

<p>
    You should get an output similar to this
</p>

<pre><code highlight="bash" src="articles/storage/output.elk"></code></pre>
